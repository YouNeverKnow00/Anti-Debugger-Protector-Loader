# Some information about
* Anti Debugger constantly scans the computer, giving a warning when it detects certain debugger names.
* I have installed and set up VMPROTECT SDK etc in the project. If you don't encrypt your application with VMProtect or any other encryption, it won't be too hard to bypass this protection.
* There are also a few small anti debugger functions, you can check them out.
* Most of the known programs, Debugger, Disassembler, HTTP Debugger, have been added, but you can add an extra, it's really simple to add, you just need to examine the code a little.
